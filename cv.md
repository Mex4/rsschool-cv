### About Me

As a process engineer in an aircraft factory, my main job is aircraft configuration management. However, I have always been interested in becoming an IT specialist, especially in the field of front-end development.

I am currently learning the basics of programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also eager to learn more about modern frontend technologies like React and TypeScript.

With my analytical and problem-solving skills, combined with a keen eye for design and attention to detail, I am confident that I can excel in the field of front-end development. I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional environment and grow as an IT specialist.
